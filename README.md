# Firefly Live
We are the team of enthusiasts, we are developing a software for musicians to allow the audience to fuse into
a single whole with the musician and all around,  to create a music together with help of illuminations,
dance and computer vision technology.

The current prototype has been made on a hackday http://hackday.ru/hackday-39/projects#project-1395.
It is a tool for generating MIDI control events based on video. It uses OpenCV to track multiple particles in realtime.
